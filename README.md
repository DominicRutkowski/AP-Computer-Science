# AP Computer Science
A compilation of projects and test projects from Mr. Ehren's AP Computer Science A class.  
Iowa City West High School | 2017-2018

# How to Open Projects
These projects were written in (or transferred to) [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). If you have IntelliJ (either the community or ultimate edition), you can open the projects directly. If you have another IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans, you will need to convert the project to a different project format for your IDE. If you are using a plain text editior such as TextPad or Sublime Text, you can find the Java files in the src directory of each project and the class files in the out/production directory of each project.

# Formatting
The code formatting follows Mr. Ehren's preferred style: tabs for indentation and new lines for opening curly braces.

# Issues
It is highly likely that both code and output formatting is messed up. The code formatting is messed up because it was copied multiple times across different IDEs. The output formatting is messed up because the code has been executed on many different JREs and operating systems. If you discover and code or output formatting issue, open an issue on the issue tracker or email rutkowski.dominic@gmail.com.
