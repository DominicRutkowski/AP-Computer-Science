# AP Computer Science
A compilation of projects and test projects from Mr. Ehren's AP Computer Science A class.  
Iowa City West High School | 2017-2018

# Formatting
The code formatting follows Mr. Ehren's preferred style: tabs for indentation and new lines for opening curly braces.

# Issues
It is highly likely that both code and output formatting is messed up. The code formatting is messed up because it was copied multiple times across different IDEs. The output formatting is messed up because the code has been executed on many different JREs and operating systems. If you discover and code or output formatting issue, open an issue on the issue tracker or email rutkowski.dominic@gmail.com
